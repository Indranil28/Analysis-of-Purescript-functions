# Analysis-of-Purescript-functions
Dive deep into PureScript's functional constructs. Analyze its compilation to JavaScript and understand modules, functions, types, &amp; classes. Based on "PureScript by Example," this project offers a detailed exploration.
This repository provides a detailed analysis of the PureScript programming language, focusing on its compilation to JavaScript. By examining the translation process, we gain a deep understanding of PureScript's functional programming constructs and how they are implemented. The project follows the structure of "PureScript by Example" and covers core concepts such as modules, functions, types, and type classes.
